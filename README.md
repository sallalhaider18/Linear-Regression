# Customer Spending Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer data to predict **Yearly Amount Spent** using **Linear Regression**. It demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature selection, and model evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer features such as:
- Avg. Session Length
- Time on App
- Time on Website
- Length of Membership
- Yearly Amount Spent (target)

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – to understand relationships and detect anomalies.  
2. **Feature Selection** – choosing the most relevant variables for prediction.  
3. **Linear Regression Modeling** – predicting yearly spending.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – using metrics like **MSE**, **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R²**.  
5. **Coefficient Analysis** – interpreting feature impact on spending.

## Key Findings
- `Length of Membership` has the highest impact on spending.  
- `Time on App` contributes more than `Time on Website`.  
- Linear regression performs well with minimal error (RMSE ~X, R² ~X).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, metrics)  
- Google Colab
